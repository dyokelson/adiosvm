Compilation
------------

Edit Makefile.inc to set compiler, flags, and the location of the FFTW and ADIOS2 libraries.
Run `make`.

This will build the simulation and the analysis codes in their respective directories.

The simulation and analysis codes are instrumented with the perfstubs library (see
https://github.com/khuck/perfstubs for details).  The instrumentation will do
nothing unless a tool that implements the API is linked into the application
either at runtime or at link time.

To include the performance tool API (supported by TAU), first do the following:

```
cd ../..
git clone https://github.com/khuck/perfstubs.git
cd perfstubs
workdir=`pwd`
rm -rf ${workdir}/build_dynamic
mkdir ${workdir}/build_dynamic
cd ${workdir}/build_dynamic

cmake \
-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=`which gcc` \
-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=`which g++` \
-DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=`which gfortran` \
-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=${workdir}/install \
-DPERFSTUBS_USE_STATIC=OFF \
..
make
make test
make install
cd ../..
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$PKG_CONFIG_PATH:`pwd`/perfstubs/install/lib/pkgconfig
cd ../brusselator/src
```

...then include the `-DPERFSTUBS_USE_TIMERS` line in the Makefile.inc file.

To build/configure TAU for this example, do the following (the papi flag is optional):

```
cd ../..
git clone https://github.com/UO-OACISS/tau2.git
cd tau2
./configure -pthread -bfd=download -dwarf=download -mpi -adios=<path-to-adios>
make install
export PATH=`pwd`/x86_64/bin:$PATH
cd ../brusselator/src
```

To build/configure PAPI (before building TAU) with component support, do the following:

```
cd ../..
wget http://icl.utk.edu/projects/papi/downloads/papi-5.7.0.tar.gz
tar -xzf papi-5.7.0.tar.gz
cd papi-5.7.0/src
./configure --prefix=<papi-install-path> --with-components="rapl nvml lmsensors net"
cd components/lmsensors
./configure --with-sensors-incdir=/usr/include/sensors
cd ../nvml
./configure --with-nvml-libdir=<path-to-cuda>/lib64 --with-nvml-incdir=<path-to-cuda>/include --with-cuda-dir=<path-to-cuda>
cd ../..
make
make install
cd ../../brusselator/src
```
